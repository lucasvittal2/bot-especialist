# Project Planning

## Phase 1 - Searching and Obtaining Knowledge
**Main Objective**: Acquire knowledge about the main methods used in semantic search, focusing on following aspects:  
1. **How it works**  
2. **Pros and cons**

### Methods to Study:
- **Vectorial Distance Calculation**
- **Graph-based Semantic Search**

---

## Phase 2 - Experimentation and Hypothesis Testing (POCs)
**Main Objectives**:  
- Conduct experiments to empirically determine which semantic search method offers the best performance.  
- Evaluate the feasibility of intent extraction.  

### Steps:
1. **Design the structure for all experiments**  
2. **Define how to measure results**  
3. **Execute experiments, document results, and summarize key takeaways**

---

## Phase 3 - Prototype Design Using GCP Environment
**Main Objective**: Build a prototype based on the results from the experiments.

### Tasks:
1. **Design the architecture diagram**
2. **Develop the requirement document**
3. **Create a logical flow diagram**
4. **Prepare backlog stories** for:
    - Development  
    - Testing  
    - Test switching  
    - API consumption documentation  
    - User guide on how to run the app  
5. **Develop the prototype** and create all necessary documentation
