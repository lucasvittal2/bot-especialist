SUMMARY:
  CONSISTENCY_EVALUATION:
    EVALUATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: \nYou will be given one summary written for an article. Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions very carefully. \nPlease keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\n{criteria}\n\nEvaluation Steps:\n{steps}\n\nExample:\n\nSource Text:\n\n{source_text}\n\nSummary:\n\n{summary}\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- {metric_name}\n
    REASONING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: \nYou will be given with a summarized text, source text, an evaluation metric criteria, evaluation metric name and value. Your task is providing the reasoning for the evaluation metric given the metrics criteria.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions very carefully. \nPlease keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\nSource Text:\n\n{source_text}\n\nSummary:\n\n{summary}\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\n{criteria}\n\nEvaluation Metric:\n\n- {metric_name}\n- {metric_value}\n
    EVALUATION_CRITERIA: \nConsistency(1-5) - the factual alignment between the summary and the summarized source. A factually consistent summary contains only statements that are entailed by the source document. Annotators were also asked to penalize summaries that contained hallucinated facts.\n
    EVALUATION_STEPS: \n1. Read the article carefully and identify the main facts and details it presents.\n2. Read the summary and compare it to the article. Check if the summary contains any factual errors that are not supported by the article.\n3. Assign a score for consistency based on the Evaluation Criteria.\n

  MATCHING_EVALUATION:
    EVALUATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: You will be given two summaries, one generated by an LLM from original  text and another one generated by human a named as expected summary. Your task is to evaluate if both summaries matches or not.Your answer must be strictly  ‘YES’ or ‘NO’\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions very carefully. \nPlease keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n{criteria}\nEvaluation Steps:\n{steps}\nExample:\nLLM summary:\n{llm_summary}\n Expected summary:\n{expected_summary}\nEvaluation Form (‘YES’ or ‘NO’ only):\n- {metric_name}
    REASONING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: You will be given two summaries, one generated by an LLM from original  text and another one generated by human a named as expected summary. Your task is reasoning  about matching evaluation between LLM generated summary and expected summary and provide a justification for evaluation results according the given criteria.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions very carefully. \nPlease keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\nLLM summary:\n{llm_summary}\n\nExpected summary:\n{expected_summary}\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n{criteria}\n\nEvaluation Metric:\n- {metric_name}\n- {metric_value}
    EVALUATION_CRITERIA: YES when :\n\t   Both summaries are in the same context and discuss the same subject.\n\tBoth summaries contain similar information.\n\tMost of the information in one summary is also present in the other, meaning one summary can replace the other.\n\tThey are semantically similar; both convey the same ideas, even if they use different wording.\n\nNO when:\n\t  Both summaries are in different contexts and discuss different subjects.\n\tBoth summaries contain distinct information.\n\tLittle of the information in one summary is present in the other, meaning one summary cannot replace the other.\n\tThey are semantically dissimilar; each conveys different ideas, even if they use similar wording.
    EVALUATION_STEPS: Ensure that both summaries are set in the same context and address the same subject.\nCheck that both summaries contain similar information.\nVerify that the majority of information in one summary is also included in the other, allowing one summary to potentially replace the other.\nAssess the summaries for semantic similarity; confirm that they convey the same ideas, even if different wording is used.

  CONSISTENCY_EVALUATION:
    EVALUATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE:  You will be given two sequences of keywords extracted from a source text. One generated by a LLM and other extracted by a Human.\nYour task is Count how many words are semantically identical (i.e., have the same meaning) between the two sequences of keywords.\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions very carefully. \nPlease keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\nEvaluation Criteria:\n{criteria}\nEvaluation Steps:\n{steps}\nExample:\nSequence of keywords generated by LLM:\n{llm_keywords}\nSequence of extracted generated by Human:\n{expected_aspects}\n\n Source text:\n{source_text}\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n{criteria}\n\nSteps:\n{steps}\n\n\nEvaluation Form (count number ONLY):\n- {metric_name}
    REASONING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: You will be given two sequences of keywords extracted from a source text. One generated by a LLM and other extracted by a Human.\nYour task is justify the number of counting similar words between two sequences according to the given criteria  below.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions very carefully. \nPlease keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\nSequence of keywords generated by LLM:\n{llm_keywords}\n\nSequence of extracted generated by Human:\n{expected_aspects}\n\nSource text:\n{source_text}\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n{criteria}\n\n\nMetric Name:\n {metric_name}\n\nMetric Value:\n{metric_value}
    EVALUATION_CRITERIA: Two words are semantically identical if they are synonyms, meaning they share the same or very similar meanings.\n\nEven if two words are not direct synonyms, they may have equivalent meanings in a specific context.\nSome words have multiple meanings. To determine if two words are semantically identical, consider the meaning that applies in the given context.\n\nWords with the same root or stem may be considered semantically identical, even if they have different suffixes or forms.
    EVALUATION_STEPS: Compare each word from both sequences for direct synonyms, words that share the same or very similar meanings.\n\nCheck if two words have equivalent meanings in the context of source text provided by the sequences.\n\nIf a word has multiple meanings (polysemy), determine the correct meaning in the  context of source text theb check for semantic equivalence with the other word.\n\nFor each word in the sequences, check if the words are variations of the same root or stem, e.g., "run," "running," "runner".
